"LoPy-GPS-ThingsNetwork-Dragino" 


This project uses a LoRa device (Pycom LoPy) and a GPS sensor (via Pycom PyTracker board) to send a LoRa message to a single channel LoRa
gateway (Dragino LG01). The sensor data will be forwarded from the gateway, to The Things Network backend. 

The single channel gateway only supports ABP, so we will use ABP. The ABP values used by the device will correspond to the values generated by TTN backend when we create the device there. 

TTN supports the ability to trigger a HTTP request when it receives the LoRa message. We will also confiure the HTTP in TTN backend, to forward the message to another server. The tricky bit here was getting the TTN HTTP payload to succesfully send a "decoded" version of the GPS coordinates. To sucesfully be able to pass on the decided payload from TTN HTTP integration, the Pycom LoPy device cannot send the GPS as a float or a string, and must encode accordingly. You will see a function on the LoPy that encodes the GPS coordinates into a byte array. By sending it in this format, we can ensure TTN HTTP payload format can contain a decoded version of the GPS data. 
The code that is used on TTN network (to decode the encoded GPS) is contained in a file called TTNDecoder.txt (this will be copied into your TTN backend pyload configuration).
